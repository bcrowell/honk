  #   This factor is because empirically, without it, the tone comes out much too bright by ear.
  #   The 1000 is just so that the factor comes out to be of order unity.
  #   I determined the exponent as follows. Found a recording with a solo violin note (Perlman, A la carte) at 290 Hz. Took its spectrum
  #   in audacity, which I assume is a power spectrum. Measured roll-off of spectrum by comparing 1st and 7th partial: -5.2 dB power per octave.
  #   Compared with synthesized note, -1.5 dB power per octave. Correction is -2.3 dB amplitude per octave, which corresponds to
  #   an exponent of ((ln10)/(10ln2))(-2.3)=-0.76. After inserting this factor, checked that the spectrum's envelope seemed to match
  #   the real violin note, and it did seem to.
